I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies.I knew then that I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Programming professionally. <br>I'm currently an Intern at Wits Tshimologong Digital Innovation Prencinct , Johannesburg , obtaining practical experience in Software Development. After the program, I plan on transferring to be employed as a Junior Software Developer .

            <h3>Software Developer Intern: Wits Tshimologong Digital Innovation Prencinct</h3>
            <p>Â Software Development Internship Programs address the issue of graduates having difficulty finding jobs in software development. According to research, graduates lack the necessary knowledge and skills to enter the workforce and become productive in a relatively short period of time. Employers, on the other hand, prefer to wait for developers with at least 2 to 4 years of experience before considering them for job placement. Meanwhile, the industry continues to outsource outside of our borders.

                As a result, software development internships provide an opportunity for candidates to compete for selection, which is recognized by employers as a source of quality candidates. Using the Tshimologong networks, this program aims to achieve 100 percent employment.</p>

                <p> Fiesprint Food Recognition , My software solution seeks to solve food related challenges

                    and will let them look through a large database of recipes. The system
                    will only return recipes containing the food items they have on hand

                    products. The software solution also assists users with their health
                    goals, whether theyâre trying to lose/gain weight or maybe introduce
                    themselves to healthier food(s) diet.</p>
